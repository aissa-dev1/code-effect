## Features

- **Dynamic Character Generation**: Characters are dynamically generated and displayed on the canvas at intervals, with random positions and speeds.
- **Animated Text Content**: The app features animated text that falls from the top of the screen, with the content changing at regular intervals.
- **Randomized Appearance**: The app randomly selects font sizes, speeds, and positions for the falling characters, creating a varied and unpredictable visual output.
